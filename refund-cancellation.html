<strong>Refund and Cancellation Policy</strong>
<p>
  At uviQo technologies Pvt Ltd, we value our customers and strive to ensure satisfaction with our services provided through the yRush app. This policy outlines the circumstances under which a refund or cancellation may be considered.
</p>
<p><strong>Refund Policy</strong></p>
<p>
  Our services available through the yRush app are primarily digital and thus considered final and non-refundable. However, we understand that exceptional circumstances may occur. Refunds for purchases may be considered by uviQo technologies Pvt Ltd under the following conditions:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Technical issues: If you encounter technical problems that prevent the proper use of the service and our team cannot resolve the issue.</li>
  <li>Accidental purchases: If a purchase was made accidentally and the services have not been utilized.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  All refund requests must be submitted within 7 days of the purchase date. To request a refund, please contact our support team at support@yrush.in with your purchase details.
</p>
<p><strong>Cancellation Policy</strong></p>
<p>
  For recurring subscription services offered by yRush, customers may cancel their subscriptions at any time. The cancellation will take effect at the end of the current billing cycle, and you will not be charged for the subsequent cycle.
</p>
<p>
  To cancel your subscription, please follow the instructions within the app or contact our support team for assistance.
</p>
<p>
  Please note, any subscriptions cancelled mid-term do not qualify for a prorated refund.
</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Our Refund and Cancellation Policy</strong></p>
